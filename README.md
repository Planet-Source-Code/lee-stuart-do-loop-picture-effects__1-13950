## Do Loop Picture Effects


</div>

### Description

Well, this code does picture effects like rotate and invert, birighten, darken etc etc....

Except!

It is using do loops.

No calls from DLL's or anything.

Just pure VB code.

It's for beginners once again, that like i few ppl I know, have no clue of API calls or anything like that.

The comments are clear and simple, they should be pretty easy to understand =), I hope you learn something from it. Enjoy!
